### Hi, I'm Jose Figueroa

**About Me**

I am a Staff Characterization Engineer at Semtech Corporation focused on embedded software with a proven track record of success in the semiconductor industry. This repository showcases my projects and contributions in the field of embedded systems development. I am passionate about developing firmware and software solutions for microcontrollers and embedded systems. With a strong background in embedded C/C++, debugging, performing testing, and designing efficient and reliable software for various microcontroller platforms. 

**Personal Projects**

[Embedded Software Development Courses](https://github.com/JoseLuis-Figueroa/Courses): This repository contains a collection of professional courses related to embedded systems, firmware development, and programming languages.

[Reusable Firmware Development](https://github.com/JoseLuis-Figueroa/Reusable-Drivers): This repository showcases a personal project focused on creating reusable firmware solutions. It includes drivers and hardware abstraction layers (HALs) for microcontrollers, following industry-standard coding practices such as MISRA-C. The project aims to provide efficient and scalable firmware components that can be integrated into various microcontrollers.

[ADXL345 Driver](https://github.com/JoseLuis-Figueroa/adxl345-driver): The repository leverages an ADXL345 driver using reusable SPI and DIO drivers to create a bridge between the sensor and the microcontroller. The implementation is composed of embedded C (Bare-Metal) and adheres to industry-standard coding practices like MISRA-C. This allows for direct and efficient interaction with the MCU's register map, unlocking the full potential of the ADXL345 accelerometer.
