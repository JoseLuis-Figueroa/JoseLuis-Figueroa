# Hi, I'm Jose Figueroa  

## About Me  

I am a **Firmware Engineer** with expertise in **microcontroller programming, automation test equipment, and hardware debugging**. My work focuses on creating **efficient, scalable, and reusable firmware solutions** for real-world applications.  

This repository serves as my **portfolio**, showcasing my expertise in **embedded software, peripheral driver development, and low-level hardware interaction**. I specialize in firmware development for microcontrollers, including **STM32, ATmega, and ATXmega families**, and have experience with **ARM, RISC-V, and AVR architectures**.  

With a strong foundation in **Embedded C, C++, Python, debugging, and testing methodologies**, I am passionate about optimizing performance and ensuring reliability in embedded systems while adhering to **industry-standard coding practices** such as **MISRA-C**.  

Beyond firmware development, I have experience in **hardware review**, including schematics and PCB analysis, as well as hands-on expertise in **automating test equipment** such as oscilloscopes, power supplies, signal generators, etc.

      <h3><a href="https://github.com/JoseLuis-Figueroa/UART-DMA-Driver">UART-DMA Driver</a></h3>
      <p>
         Demonstrates efficient UART communication using DMA.
         This implementation enables data transfer between 
         the UART peripheral and memory buffers while bypassing
         the CPU for improved performance.
