## Personal Projects  

[**UART-DMA Driver**](https://github.com/JoseLuis-Figueroa/UART-DMA-Driver)

This project demonstrates efficient **UART communication using DMA** (Direct Memory Access) on the **STM32 Nucleo-F401RE**. The system is designed to transfer data between the **UART peripheral** and the **transmitter/receiver buffers** in memory while bypassing the CPU for data handling, improving performance and efficiency. The **DMA** is configured to transfer data with minimal CPU intervention, enhancing throughput and ensuring reliable communication. The project utilizes **reusable UART and DMA drivers**, adhering to **MISRA-C** standards for reliable, maintainable code. Implemented with **bare metal** and **Embedded C**, this project showcases my ability to design and implement **high-performance communication solutions** for embedded systems, with real-time data exchange visualized using **Putty**.

[**ADXL345 Driver**](https://github.com/JoseLuis-Figueroa/adxl345-driver)

This project demonstrates the development of a **driver for the ADXL345 accelerometer** on the **STM32 Nucleo-F401RE**. It utilizes **reusable drivers** for both **SPI** and **DIO** to efficiently interface with the ADXL345 sensor, enabling the reading of acceleration data across three axes. The driver implementation adheres to industry standards such as **MISRA-C** and is designed to be scalable and reusable across different microcontroller platforms. The project showcases my skills in **low-level hardware interfacing**, sensor integration, and optimizing data communication for embedded systems.

[**Reusable Peripheral Drivers**](https://github.com/JoseLuis-Figueroa/Reusable-Peripheral-Drivers)

This repository showcases **reusable peripheral driver development** and **low-level hardware interaction** for STM32 microcontrollers, demonstrating the type of **firmware solutions** I can deliver as a **freelancer/firmware engineer**. These reusable drivers are designed with **modularity, scalability, and reusability** in mind, allowing them to be updated to support different microcontroller families and vendors. The drivers are built following **best practices** in firmware development and industry standards such as **MISRA-C**.
